- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

My initial impressions of Inheritance were that it wasn't necessary, as I thought it would be easier to write out everything for each class. However, I found it very useful after completing this assignment, and I now understand why it is helpful. I thought that this assignment went very smoothly for me. Creating the three separate classes that were slightly different but all coming from the Building class was helpful as I got more familiar with the syntax of inheritance. The only issues I had were sometimes I got confused with calling the variables inside the methods, but I was always able to figure it out.
